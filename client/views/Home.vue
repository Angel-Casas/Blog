    <div id="intro-message">
      <p>It is in the same spirit as Isaac Asimov's that I want to document my learning process, because some time ago I came across an idea that settled my way of seeing the world: aim at the most valuable goal you can conceive of and gradually move towards achieving that goal with small incremental steps.</p>
      <p>In this logic and with this conviction, it seemed to me that writing a blog and sharing my ideas with anyone who comes across these pages can help me to get closer to the conquest of my goals, because by transmitting my ideas I can gain a clearer understanding of my shortcomings and perhaps my audience can help me to correct those failures in which I will fall without being aware of them.</p>
      <p>In this sense, I have been fortunate enough to find the intellectual peaks that I want to conquer in my lifetime, and, just as a farmer sowing seeds in the ground begins a living relationship with the plant that grows for years to come with the promise of good fruit or good shelter, I seek to maintain this relationship that I began some years ago in the field of computer science, economic science and the study of mathematics, a relationship that fills me with a sense of fulfillment as it roots my knowledge of the world around me.</p>
      <p>Having lived most of my childhood surrounded by nature, I have learned to appreciate its beauty and have slowly developed an awareness of the mysteries it hides, which is why I have decided to introduce in this blog a section dedicated exclusively to nature and its beauty.</p>
