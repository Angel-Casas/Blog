        <p>I pour great amounts of time, effort, though and resources into growing this blog and keeping all the content free forever (and ad-free).</p>
        <p>
        This requires many hours a month to research and compile all the information necessary to produce each post and this leads to a 
        high need for income in order to become sustainable and to keep improving. If you find joy and value what is being produced here, 
        please consider becoming a Sustaining Patron with a recurring monthly donation of your choosing between a cup of coffee and a good lunch. 
        Your support helps keep free, public and valuable articles going and it really matters.
